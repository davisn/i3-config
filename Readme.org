#+title: i3 Config

* About

  This is my i3 config.
  I'm making it public in case any one else wants
  to incorporate similar features into their own config.
  For the most part, it's just the default config with some minor tweaks:

  * Graphics mode set to 1920x1080 on startup
    (may need to change output to appropriate value,
    and change mode if desired)
  * Keyboard layout changed to Dvorak

  That's it for now, but I might add more in the future.
